# Enigma
Enigma Machine Emulator C++

This project will emulate the World War 2 Enigma machine using authentic rotor and reflector configurations. 

The plugboard configuration, number; types, and order of rotors; type of reflector, and initialization vector for rotor starting potisions will be configurable from command-line arguments, or .ini cofiguration file.

The intended mode of operation is to read a text stream from stdin and write out the oposite encoding to stdout.
